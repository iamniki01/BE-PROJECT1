# BE-PROJECT1
Purchasing and Shopping at big malls is becoming daily activity in metro cities. We can see big rush at these malls on holidays and weekends. This crowd becomes huge when there are special offers and discount. People purchase different items and put them in trolley. After total purchase one need to go to billing counter for payments. At billing counter, the cashier prepares the bill using bar code reader which is very time consuming process and results in long queue at billing counter. To make hassle free, this project is developed as a gesture based embedded system. Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology may not only be useful for streamlining inventory and supply chains, it could also make shoppers swarm. Each product of shopping mall, super markets will be provided with a RFID tag, to identify its type. Each shopping cart is designed or implemented with a Product Identification that contains microcontroller, LCD, an RFID reader and RF module. The information of the purchased product will be read through a RFID reader on shopping cart. The central billing system gets the cart information and information will be sent to android using GSM module(MODEM). Main aim of this paper was to provide automatic billing to avoid queue in malls and super markets.
